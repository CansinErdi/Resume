    <h1>Resume of Cansin Erdi</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <h3>
        <p>A dynamic professional with a unique blend of creative and technical skills. 
        I started with studies in architecture and a formal culinary education, went on to work in high-end hospitality (including at a Michelin star–winning team in Nürnberg and at 360 East Istanbul—a renowned restaurant celebrated for its panoramic 360° view and modern Turkish cuisine), and later became an entrepreneur by owning and selling DelaTurca.
         I further expanded my expertise as a market specialist at TikTok in Berlin. 
         Now, I am transitioning into the IT sector with a focus on web development and cloud technologies, aiming to merge my experience in digital marketing, operations, and creative problem solving.
            </p>
